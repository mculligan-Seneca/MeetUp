What is this project?

This project MEETUP is a practice project for myself to get better at creating coding projects. It allows for strangers to post events they would like others to attend within the area. The whole purpose is to get out there and meet new people. 



People can post events 
People can subscribe to events
They can chat with the poster of the event perhaps have a group chat going, etc.
Only things i've come up with so far.


Should use Google maps api to retrieve events that have been posted within the area.


Potential pages concept:

 - Maps page to display.
 - List view for events in area (more explicit view of data but should be identical to map page).
 - Chat page. (Can chat with others in the current events that you are signed up for.) 



 Map Page - What can you do?
  - Look for events in your current area.
  - pin events for later?
  - Click on events and join them for later
  - Should be able to filter events perhaps based on their tag, age range, group size etc.

List view for displaying events - What can you do
    - Virtually everything you can do in the map view but the data is compressed into a list format



List view and map view can be combined into the same kind of page the events page.
